- ISSUE: GI Article scraper does not get get all content.
EX. Super Replay: Galerians content stops at first video.

6/2/20

- Get 'host' and 'featuring' from base Super Replay page and only use
if there is no 'host' or 'featuring' in episodes.
ISSUE: Would need 'host' and 'featuring' to be undefined for most Super
Replays since most super replay episodes has their own 'host' and 'featuring'.

- GI article not being saved to SuperReplay object. May need to add
parameter to fandom page scraper to make scraping GI article optional.
OR set to external links in SuperReplay class.

5/23/20

- Send GI article url from SuperReplay to SuperReplayEpisode. If there
is any GI articles in the episode page, only scrape and add if different
than base GI article url.

- Check if tags property in YouTubeVideo is working

- Subtract one second from youtube duration and one day from youtube
publishedAt

- Check that youtube playlist in Super Replay base page applies each
video ID to each episode correctly. Sonic the Hedgehog does NOT work.

2/24/20

- Create function to update list which adds any new
episodes to top of list and then updates YouTube data
using API
function updateEpisodeList():
	- Get most recent episode number from first index
	of episode list
	- Add new episodes
	- Update list using YouTube API

- Separate scrape function to create function that scrapes episode
and returns the episode object

corrected text. Ignore text with strike through in html (<s></s>).

12/25/19

replay episodes

12/16/19
