                "Welcome back to Replay's first episode of 2020! We hope you all had a great holiday season and we're thrilled to be back. While it may seem like a distant memory, Blade was one of the first major properties that Marvel brought to the big screen. And with each superhero film\u00a0from the early 2000's also came a painful movie tie-in game, and Blade is no exception. Join us as we take on the seedy thugs as what we think is supposed to be Wesley Snipes while also discussing the bonkers trivia from the creation of Blade 3.",
