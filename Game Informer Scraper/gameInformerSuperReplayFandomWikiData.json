This is the first 12/31 Super Replay without Tim Turi, so it's a departure from the survival horror games that are typically played on 12/31. This can be seen as a new beginning for the 12/31 Super Replay - moving on from OverBlood and games of its ilk, and expanding the definition of \"bad\" Super Replay games."

                "Cyberia 2 was the featured game in the twenty-first installment of Super Replay. It premiered on November 16, 2013. It was hosted by Andrew Reiner, Tim Turi, Jeff Cork, Dan Ryckert, and Zach Pligge. It is the sequel to the thirteenth Super Replay installment Cyberia, a game made famous for just how much it frustrated Tim Turi. ",
                "The sequel improved almost nothing, and in some cases was actually worse than its predecessor. Although Tim still considers the original Cyberia to be the worst game he has ever beaten (which the crew was surprised with, as it looked to them like Cyberia 2 was worse), he was still quite frustrated by this game as well for very similar reasons, asking out loud in the second episode, \"How does it suck so bad in so many similar ways to the original? How did they learn nothing!?\" Dan Ryckert agreed, stating, \"If you didn't have a walkthrough, this game would be unbeatable.\""

                        "Playing as a character named Zak, whose back-story is not given any mention in the game itself (but is detailed quite extensively in the instruction manual for some odd reason), the first part of the game takes place in an oil rig in the ocean, where Zak has to pick up a computer-automated fighter jet (or \"trans-fighter\") to fly to Siberia, Russia, where the final section of the game takes place, infiltrate a scientific research complex, and find a top-secret project called the Cyberia Weapon. Immediately upon arriving, a PA announcement tells Zak to \"take the door on the right, and don't wander around.\"",
                        "Tim wanders around, though, and seven minutes into the game, he discovers the first instance of a recurring problem in Cyberia: just how easy it is to die without any warning. He is shot to death by a character that the crew notices bears a resemblance to Mike Ehrmantraut from Breaking Bad, so they refer to him as Mike henceforth.",
                        "Eventually, Tim goes through the correct door and progresses the story, defending the oil rig from an attack by operating a turret. Afterwords, Zak kisses a woman he met three minutes prior, causing the apparently jealous owner of the rig to take him hostage. In a scuffle, both he and the woman are killed, freeing Zak. Tim guides Zak through two shootouts, both of which are against people who look like Mike, and then disarms a bomb on the trans-fighter, which he then boards and flies away on.",
                        "It should be noted, however, that all of the above takes up most of the replay episode, largely because Tim dies over a dozen times due to various different causes without any sort of warning. These deaths include, but are not limited to: slipping on spilled oil, sticking Zak's hand in a barrel of burning acid, failing to disarm a bomb due to a laughably absurd-looking puzzle, walking off a suspended platform, and being shot to death by the stealthy and seemingly ever-present Mike.",

Inconveniently, the automatic weapons system fails, so while the flight is automated, the shooting isn't.  ",

On top of not being particularly enjoyable, Tim notes that the D-pad is the only way of moving the firing cursor, making many of the levels incredibly frustrating to play. The most notable is the fourth one, which takes place in a short but narrow traffic tunnel containing both enemy forces and oil trucks that explode if shot even once. Because of how many enemies there are on screen at any given time, as well as the unresponsiveness of the D-pad controls, it takes the crew twenty minutes to beat, resulting in loud applause for Tim when he finally does.

                "OverBlood 2 is the featured game of the tenth installment of Super Replay. It premiered on December 31, 2011 and ended on February 23, 2012 with episode 20, making it the longest Super Replay (as of August 2012). It continues the 12/31 tradition of playing terrible games established with it's prequel OverBlood. It is the most anticipated Super Replay to date, due to the popularity of the OverBlood Super Replay.",
                "Prior to the airing of the Super Replay, knowledge began to circulate among the OverBlood fanbase and Game Informer staff of a glitch affecting some copies of OverBlood 2 which caused the game to freeze during a certain cutscene, leaving the player unable to progress and therefore unable to complete the game. Game Informer's copy did not include this glitch; however, the crew \"faked\" the glitch at the end of Episode 5.",

                        "This episode starts with Acarno practicing parkour in a seedy bar. The trio recaps previous events to Helgeson in the most misleading way possible as they search for the Ghost House. They talk about Letterman's \"Please Stop Calling Me Chief\", a Muay Thai boxer who would not stop saying \"bro\", Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and optional groupons. Dan talks about Muay Thai and Matt discusses Capoeira. Using Ben Hanson's advice, they blast their way into the ghost house. After fiddling around a bit, they drop a chandelier from the ceiling and peruse a very inappropriate painting. As they proceed, they discuss Naughty Dog making OverBlood 3 by simply changing the characters in Last Of Us to Raz Karcy and Pipo. Matt Helgeson attempts to equate staff members with Frasier characters. Dan is an easy shoe-in for bull-dog, Andy McNamara is the father, Jeff Marchiafava is Daphne, and Phil Kollar is Niles. They segue into discussing movies of 2011, notably Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, Super 8, and Money Ball. The team finally get through the mansion and right into a Junk Blade race, which Tim quickly loses. Three times. Then three more times. As he grows more frustrated, Tim barks at everyone to shut up as he scrapes for enough concentration and reflexes to win on the default difficulty. Almost awkwardly, and certainly unprecedented, the Replay room falls completely silent except for Tim's exasperated sighs (this may or may not be due to Hanson editing Dan out of the commentary momentarily). Tim's skill eventually overcomes the steep difficulty and he celebrates gloriously. During a cutscene showing the meeting with Marius, one of the team whistles a Star Wars melody. As it drags on, Tim decides that this is the worst video game story ever. They make the spur of the moment tie-in that Marius is old Mille from OverBlood 1. They beat the chapter \"Edgy Kids\" with a rank of A, and proceed directly into another cutscene. And another. And another. The team mostly checks out at this point, and discusses how the illustrious producer improved so much. They futilely hope that this is the last episode."

                        "Acarno gains entrance to the ghost house and takes his leave of it in short order. He encounters the leader of the gang behind the house, who claims that Buster, the child thief from the previous episode, said Acarno stole the bananas from him. Acarno attempts to set the record straight but to no avail, and it very nearly comes to blows until he says, \"I only came here to look for Doctor Marius!\" The leader and his underage thugs are taken aback, as they believe that only they know that Marius used to be a doctor. They wonder if he's \"The Traveler\", but quickly discards this notion as \"The Traveler\" is supposed to be kind and gentle, \"not stealing bananas from little kids!\". Since The Traveler is supposed to be a great Junk Blader, they challenge Acarno to a Junk Blade race, which he readily accepts. He triumphs with ease. He meets Doctor Marius, an old woman who can communicate only telepathically, but very nearly is thrown out before she can speak to him. She contacts him, though, and declares him The Traveler because his power is unmistakable. She explains that Traveler's have powers akin to hers or Acarno's sister. She talks about how they must help the world realize freedom, and tells of her past and the past of the Hull Drive. She talks of how the Hull Drive was meant to help humankind, but it was sabotaged to hurt them. She was captured and tortured, so she shut down her whole body, and is now unable restart it. The gang leader (Craka?) cries that she must leave, but Marius comforts him. There's a short monologue from Chris, and the chapter \"Edgy Kids\" concludes. The next episode begins with Marius being introduced to the rest of Acarno's friends as a Traveler, and reveals himself to be one as well. Hasaka tells of how Traveler's were exploited for their blood to use in super soldier projects. Hasaka talks about how Travelers are to be utilized as advance scouts on inhospitable planets. With this tactic, Hayano can safely colonize dangerous planets when they abandon Earth. Acarno agrees to act as Marius's proxy body, and the cutscene switches to Xeno on the bridge of the Shangri-La preparing to fire it up. Hayano and Kondo interrupt, to Xeno's dismay. Hayano explains how he suspected of the plan to steal the ship from him since the beginning. He orders Kondo to kill Xeno, but he mutates and knocks them aside. The cutscene goes back to Acarno, who makes final preparations to complete the Hull Drive. The cutscene switches back to Xeno who is still attempting to launch the ship, and then switches back to Acarno as he enables the Hull Drive to work. Acarno listens to Marius' monologue about the Earth regulating itself despite the persistent pollution mankind produces. She hypothesizes that Travelers are Earth's creations to survive on the new, polluted Earth. She urges him to use his powers for good. As their conversation ends, a massive energy drain is reported from area D5. The Shangri-La is close to launching, and when it does everyone will be doomed. A massive sinkhole opens above the Shangri-La, destroying much of the city above."

Kondo wants to let him live long enough to destroy their mutual enemies, like missile bases. Hayano says that Xeno wants to destroy the planet, without colonizing another one. Back to Acarno's group, Hasaka explains that the ship will destroy all the defenses before it hits the Starwatch perimeter, then destroy the planet. He deftly pilots the ship into a trench, and episode 7 \"Another Future\" begins.",
                        "Haska and Acarno exit the ship and make a simple plan: Get to the bridge and stop the lift-off. Meanwhile, the Hayano scientists struggle to stop Xeno's lift-off. In the hanger, Acarno and Co. come under fire. Acarno gets split off by a blast door, and continues on alone. The Ministry of Defense prepares to fire, ignoring the fact they need the President's orders first. However, a power failure prevents them from doing so. Acarno makes it to a stasis room that contains some very strange creatures. Each creature tells him a different clue through their own riddles, explaining he needs 8 Diva pieces to breach the bridge and vaguely where to find them. Acarno also needs to disable 3 holographic shutters, numerous security crystals, and enter the code correctly on the control panel."

Dan reiterates his disgust at female armpit hair, as he replayed Metal Gear Solid 2 the day prior.

Blue Stinger, a very cheesy game like OverBlood, is said to have been pushed to December 31st, the original air date for OverBlood and OverBlood 2. Dan shares his thought on Tim Schafer.

Xeno is taken off guard by this, but activates the Guardian system to preserve the ship. However, he focuses the Guardian around his position, leaving other parts of the Shangri-La vulnerable. Hayano is grievously injured by a pair of missiles that slip through the shield, and calls for help to no avail. Xeno celebrates his victory, and Hayano is crushed under rubble as he dies alone with his dreams burning around him. Hasaka blows through the blast door that separated Acarno from the rest of the party and sets off to find him. Acarno briefly explores the ship, using the elevator to go the Diva Level and encounters Kondo again. Acarno tells him of their Hull Drive and how it can save the Earth, but Kondo says he no longer cares since Hayano is dead and all his hopes are gone with him. An epic sword fight ensues which Acarno wins. After fighting his transformed shape, he returns to normal. An explosion goes off and a column nearly falls on Acarno. Kondo risks his life to save Acarno's, and thanks him for his help and encouraging words. The column proves too heavy and Kondo is crushed by it. Ironically, one of the Diva Pieces is accessible by jumping onto the column that crushed him. In the process of all of this, the antagonist (the replay crew believes) was also crushed. This leads everyone to believe that the end is near. Acarno returns to the lower level, finding it very damaged by the missile fire. He recovers a Diva Piece and returns to the labyrinth, which he navigates to a garden with another Diva Piece. He continues through the labyrinth to a room unfamiliar to Acarno but very familiar to fans of OverBlood 1."

When the fight against Xeno finally begins, the team laughs at the Dragonball Z-esque antics on the screen. They jinx each other over the words, \"Solid Snake Simulation\", and once again beg the incompetent heroes to shoot Xeno.

Xeno says her death was a small price to pay, which pushes Acarno over the edge. They fight, with Acarno unleashing the power of the Harbinger. In a genuinely badass fight, Acarno prevails. The heroes then stare at Xeno as he launches the missiles to kill millions of people. He says that the previous attacks were simulations, but these are real. Hasaka decides to take the ship as high as it can go and then self-destruct, while Xeno limps behind and taunts some more. Hasaka reveals himself as the real Hayano, and orders the ascent of the Shangri-La. He reveals that his father grew disgraced with him over reasons unheard and cloned him. Xeno tells them that it makes no difference because the self destruction was preemptively disabled. However, Hayano-Hasaka does not plan to self-destruct, he plans to have Navarro destroy the anti-matter core. Navarro faces a giant Wookiee with armor plating to destroy the engine, and is unsuccessful. Acarno and Co. leave Xeno behind, who is too weak to do any damage, and go to assist Navarro. They quickly develop a plan to crush the large monster under a large blast door. Once they succeed, Acarno enters the engine room."

The others talk about movies where humans must fight animals such as The Grey and The Edge. Dan brings up Michael Crichton's \"Small Penis Defense\".

Dan discusses making a map, and the pair continually chuckle at the caveman's sleeping habits. They go to a prehistoric tattoo parlor and get a nice pair of legs while they're at it. After glancing over prehistoric pornography, they kill a monkey and check out their body. A fellow cavemen commits suicide, they cross a river, and run with shrill screams from a bear of some sort. Then flee with equal shrillness from werewolves/panthers. They climb a mountain, but the caveman falls asleep. A deep sleep, given that it persists after falling down a mountain. Soon, they learn how to make weapons, but it is not enough to kill a pig. Dan dedicates the life of the next descendant to revenge. After creating Caveman Kratos, they head for the pig. Dan roleplays Kratos training his arms for the upcoming vengence fight. Sadly, Kratos perishes in the fight with Ganon, giving rise to his descendant, Jack Bauer.  Following his birth, Jack Bauer pledges vengence for Kratos and Magellan, his father and grandfather respectively, against Ganon."

Discovering Stonehenge, they turn south while Phil asks if Dan would get a Tail of the Sun tattoo. Dan pre-meditates the murder of a monkey, but is responsible enough to get a full night's rest before doing so. They discuss boners at length. Then Jack Bauer nearly drowns, but through sheer force of will pulls himself to shore and chases off a bird. Jack Bauer has trained his arms to perfection for the fight, at the cost of his crotch. Jack Bauer finds Ganon and readies himself for vengence. For added drama, the grave of Kratos is positioned exactly between them. During the fight, Ganon reveals that he is an amphibious killer pig, much to Dan's disbelief. During the battle, Dan discovers the right hand of the world. The battle is fleeting and unfinished, as Dan retreats to explore north. Dan tries to defend his cowardice as they climb a mountain. Dan kills a monkey, but sleeps too long and the meat spoils. Next to the death star, they spot another vitim. Dan shows his prowess at covering Springsteen. Despite running from Ganon, Jack Bauer shows his prowess by killing four monkeys and two birds, covering the history wall with many more portraits of his kills. After one last white monkey hunt, he sets off to face Ganon in a rematch, even as his life dwindles to just three flames. Regrettably, Jack dies to a buffalo before he can reach Ganon. She-Vader is born as his descendant, who blitzes for the east. For Ganon. She instead kills a sabertooth tiger, once again delaying the revengeful strike upon Ganon."

This new conversation makes Philip Kollar note that this episode has gone from \"the sexiest replay ever to the darkest replay ever\".

                "OverBlood is the featured game of the fourth installment of Super Replay. It premiered on December 31st, 2010 and ended on January 9th, 2011. It featured Dan Ryckert as host, with Tim Turi at the controls. Every episode also featured a third guest, rotating between Matt Helgeson, Andrew Reiner, Jeff Cork, Joe Juba, and Phil Kollar. It created the 12/31 tradition of playing terrible games. The tradition continued the following year with the sequel OverBlood 2.",
                "This particular installment is considered to be one of the most iconic and beloved installments of the Super Replay series, as well as one of great historical significance. According to Andrew Reiner, the original idea for Super Replay was to only play classic, critically-acclaimed games, but this was changed specifically because of how incredibly entertaining Overblood proved to be for all of its shortcomings. In Reiner's detailing the history of Super Replay, Super Replay History & Round-up , posted on July 01 2013, he stated:",
                "\"Thefirst episode of Replay aired on January 27, 2010....Game Informer senior associate editor Dan Ryckertpitched me on the idea of playing the entirety of The Legend of Zelda: ALink to the Past...Hisinitial pitch was that Super Replay would be reserved for only thegreatest games of all time. Huge names like Zelda, Mario, and ResidentEvil wouldn't be given justice with a 30-minute standard episode. Whilewe kept to that idea for several installments, our criteria for SuperReplay candidates changed when we discovered Overblood during a ReplayRoulette segment. We even threw around ideas to brand it differently,with names like Super Deplay and Super S---play, but instead decided toloosen up the restrictions on what Super Replay meant.\"",
                "In addition, the Overblood installment of Super Replay inspired a Facebook Group which has since been referenced many times in future Super Replay episodes (even outside of Overblood's installment), and Game Informer made several t-shirts featuring Pipo, a robot who appears in the game, who they now consider to be their unofficial mascot."

Upon removing it, the statue falls and kills Raz, sending the crew back to the beginning of the game. Tim learned to play a little more safely after this, being sure not to take an anti-gravity device from under a floating statue. The puzzle proved so difficult, that Ben Hanson gave Matt the solution as to what to do: push the statue over. They continue the playthrough, thwarting the deadly bust and making a significant amount of progress. The longer than usual episode ends with Tim still unable to find the Voice Recorder."
