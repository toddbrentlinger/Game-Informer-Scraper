            "When they start Hybrid Heaven, they find that no one knows who picked out the game, and then claim it might be a sign for a Super Replay. One of the characters, named Johnny, is shown walking around naked in his apartment (no M-rated parts showing) in the opening cutscene which freaks Dan out and becomes an onrunning joke during the Roulette. They also laugh out loud whenever the main character Diaz goes into a rather suggestive looking crawl. While Dan doesn't like the bland enviorment of the game, he and the others get interested with Diaz shooting Johnny, the strange combat system, and the RPG elements. They end saying they'll consider whether or not Hybrid Heaven will be a Super Replay."
