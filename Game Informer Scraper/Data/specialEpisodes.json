We take a look at four games in this episode, all set within Namco's Splatterhouse series. Tim Turi and Jason Oestreicher work their way through each game, showing us just how difficult they are, and how much the Terror Mask changes in each game. Our journey begins original arcade release and concludes with an oddity not many people know about. We hope you all have a great Halloween, and end up getting a great assortment of candy that is mostly free of that crappy taffy in orange and black wrappers."

        "By now, you may have heard the news that Michael Mendheim, the creator of Mutant League Football, is launching a Kickstarter to create a spiritual successor to the Genesis-era cult classic. To celebrate, host Andy Reiner welcomes Matt Helgeson, Ben Reeves, Kim Wallace, and Jason Oestreicher to the Replay studio to see how the original holds up. The results are a bit ugly at times \u2013 to hilarious results. Also, without spoiling anything, in the Replay Roulette segment, Ben Reeves pulls off one of the most pathetic \"feats\" in Replay history, to Kim's chagrin."
